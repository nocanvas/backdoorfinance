    <h1>SCRT Island üèùÔ∏è</h1>

    <p>
     We are building a SCRT validator which will net you credits that can be redeemed for invites to our SCRT island.</p>
     <h2>Wait, there is a SCRT Island?</h2>
       <p>
     Well, yes ... and no.  Depends who you know. If you knew me, yes, you can get invited. If you own a yacht and maybe a seaplane we can get you out here no problem. But other than that you need to get invited.... and thats where the SCRT Validator comes in.</p>
     <p>
    Stake your SCRT on the SCRTisland validator and you will earn a token which can be redeemed for an invite to a SCRT island conference, time TBD</p>
     <h2>This sounds made up...</h2>
       <p>
     I happen to love SCRT, and also manage and run a private island for water sports enthusiast, but you'd only have gone if you were a professional athlete or own a fortune 500 company. However I want to make the meme a reality and have SCRT island conference with our community.</p>
