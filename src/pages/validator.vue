    <h1>SCRT Validator</h1>
    <p>Our SCRT Validator is pending. We are using a VPS provider within the SCRT community to deploy our server with all the standards required by SCRT. </p>
    <p>It's super legit, no bs, won't dissapear, won't get hacked, etc. (how do I know?) because I pay good money for the validator to run up to snuff. No shortcuts, no cutting corners.</p>
